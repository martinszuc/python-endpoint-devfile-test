  description: "Python (version 3.9.x) is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
    Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together."
